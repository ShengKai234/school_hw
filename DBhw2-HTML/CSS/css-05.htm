Poor Cookie never got even a mention. Of course, that was because as soon as she heard the doorbell, she ran under the bed and stayed there until the guests had long gone home. I'm not sure why she was so shy with people. It might have to do with the fact that she was born in a planter on the busiest street in Barcelona, and I abducted her from her mother all of a sudden one Saturday morning to bring her home to our sixth floor apartment, with the aforementioned big, American cat.<P>Cookie was only six weeks old or so at the time. We thought that maybe Woody would eat her, or at least be mean to her--he'd never been with other cats, and he was so big that he could've done what he wanted. Or so we thought.<P>What happened of course, was very different. Tiny little Cookie, no bigger than Woody's front paw (well, maybe a little bigger, but not much), hissed at poor Woody and bopped him on the head and told him in no uncertain terms that he better get out of her room, or else. They got to be friends after a while, she often mistaking his tail for a venomous snake, he getting over his initial shock and wrestling with her as often as she would let him.</BODY></HTML>
